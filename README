Notes:

index.jade is the main html file
A page consists of a
  jade file
  a javascript file
  a css file
By convention these files are named the same for a page
example:
  change.js
  chage.jade
  change.css

There is no automatic loading of anything to add a new page
you must add all the parts to the index.jade file manually.

See files
  public/index.jade [ line 80, 114, 123 ]
  public/pages/change.jade
For an example of how to extend the application with a new page.
