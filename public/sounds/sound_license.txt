Thankyou for downloading this!

I am really pleased to present to you the "Essential Chip Sounds" sample pack,
a collection of 8-bit and glitchy audio samples constructed throughout 2011.
I have always loved the raw and groovy waveforms that retro consoles generate.
The tones, textures and unique warmth of these systems are the main reason that
they have continued to be a staple sound source in my production.

I have put together this sample pack from my personal collection of sounds which 
have been designed with a variety of different programs and recorded from a variety
of emulated and actual lo-bit systems. The samples here are entirely original and 
have been extracted from most of my music released last year or designed exclusively 
for this release. There are over 250 individual sounds and loops in this sample pack
including a folder of SFX designed for an independant arcade game that was never 
released. This sample pack is royalty free, meaning that you are more than welcome
to use these sounds in your creative projects, either commercial or non-commerical. 

If you enjoy this collection please feel free to donate and buy me a digital beer,
you can find a link on my website!
